// single stream. A decoder that starts mid-file produces a garbage first field
// while it locks on, then converges onto exactly the output a single serial
// decode would have produced for that part of the file. We exploit that by
// having the earlier ("authoritative") decoder overlap into the next decoder's
// region and, once `overlap_count` consecutive fields agree, hand off to the
// later decoder — which has already decoded ahead in parallel.
//
// Determinism: segment boundaries are fixed (`seg * distance_size` fields), each
// decoder is deterministic, and every stitch decision (earlier decoder wins,
// first `overlap_count`-in-a-row match stitches) is independent of thread timing.
